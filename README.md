**RSS Feed Reader**:

This project was created as my introduction into Full Stack Development. This project is extremely bare-bone and only the core functionality has been implemented.

The funcion of a RSS Feed Reader is to parse HTML elements and extract raw information to redisplay on our website so that user's dont have to visit numerous Blogs and articles to retrieve their wanted information. 
Instead all the links to those blogs and articles can be inputted into my RSS Feed Reader and the content will be displayed at a central location.

For example:

Run the web application and insert this link: 'https://blog.cardkingdom.com/feed'

Assumptions:
*  The URL you're entering is a valid RSS feed. Some websites have moved away from RSS or hide their feeds
*  Some sites donâ€™t use a standard /feed or /rss path. So if the link isn't working, try adding '/feed' or '/rss' paths
